# Multi-Faced Cards

## Overview

Magic: the Gathering has a variety of card layouts that are considered "multi-face". These layouts are often identified by an accompanying game mechanic like Transform. Another, less obvious, example would be cards with a "split" layout such as [Armed // Dangerous](https://scryfall.com/card/dgm/122/armed-dangerous) or [Appeal // Authority](https://scryfall.com/card/hou/152/appeal-authority).
